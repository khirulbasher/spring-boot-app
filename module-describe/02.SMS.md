##SMS:A Security Management System
    Where the role and authority dynamically assigned for any kind of Front-End and Back-End Action Like:
         Admin can instantly give a Set of rule which implies that if anyone do that type of task
         at back-end[if back-end-security-enabled] then they must have these type of Auth
            and Front-End Also the same rule;
         




##Business Logic And Domain Models:
####Active Back-End Security: 
######SecurityUtils.IS_BACK_END_SECURITY_ENABLED=true
######SecurityUtils.IS_BACK_END_SECURITY_ENABLED=true
######Permission.getByName('BackEndSecurityEnable') ==null Or Permission.getByName('SecurityEnable').enable==null or true
######Permission.getByName('FrontEndSecurityEnable') ==null Or Permission.getByName('SecurityEnable').enable==null or true
        i    [SmsAction]: It contains Action actionIdentity like:
                a.Add
                b.Edit
                c.Delete
                d.View
                e.AddMore
                with meaningful action name and description
                
        ii   [SmsActionGroup]: Collection of Action with some property:
                list of roles:
                    a. hasAnyRoles: [It implies that if user want to do that avtivity and if and only if previous condition was meet and any authority from these role then only do that activity ]
                    a.1 enableHasAnyRoles:enable or disable above role check
                    b. hasRoles: [Same As Above, just must contain all of authority from role]
                    b.1 enableHasRoles:enable or disable above role check
                    c. hasNoAnyRoles: [Same As Above, just if principal dosn't have any one of the authority]
                    c.1 enableHasNoAnyRoles:enable or disable above role check
                    d. hasNoRoles: [Same As Above, just if principal dosn't have all of the authority]
                    d.1 enableHasNoRoles:enable or disable above role check
        iii  [SmsSubModule]: It is a Collection of SmsActionGroup
                with some properties:
                    a.domain: it is generally the class name on which you want to apply that role permission check
                          It taken from url parts :like:->
                                Our has ums module: when we develop erp then each module's files put on a directory named [module]
                                and the viewed separate separate ui-view element and state named after module
                                with module.js[state],module.controller.js[controller-for-dashboard,and module element],module.html[ui-view]
                          that time our each of the model-view has the url pattern: {host}/{module_name}/{domain_name}/{view/edit/del etc}
                          and then the domain part of that module is collected from url-path
                    and name: a meaningful name to the submodule
        iv   [SmsModule]: Collection of submodule:
                props: name: module_name taken from above url
                
                
                
##Security Apply Business:
    SecurityUtils.securityData=Map<DomainName,SecurityMetadata>
    
    
##BackDoor:
    It is a Security Level Task:
        If Backdoor Enabled:
            Then ROLE_ADMIN only can Use and Access Some Of Modules[UMS,SMS] whose are 
            Suddenly not accessible to ROLE_ADMIN because of doing/apply himself an unplanned security rules, and then even ROLE_ADMIN
            can change that role if and only if the user[ROLE_ADMIN] ary trying 
            SecurityUtils.BACK_DOOR_COUNT_LIMIT identically the same action then 
            the back-door is open and ADMIN_CAN_CHANGE_OR_RECOVER_THE_PREVIOUS Mistake.
            
        Type Of Work for which the system provide a backdoor:
            Suppose ROLE_ADMIN make a Security Rule to [UMS/SMS] Module and that was enabled
            and the ROLE_ADMIN stand a Security Law, that if Any ROLE_ADMIN try to access any kind of 
            data on UMS/SMS module then they must have the ROLES: ROLE_ADMIN & ROLE_SECURITY_ADMIN & ROLE_NEW_ADMIN
            and because of the ROLE_NEW_ADMIN didn't assign before to any admin
            so there's no one can access the UMS/SMS module and can't change the role of and can't disable the UMS/SMS Module Security Rule.
